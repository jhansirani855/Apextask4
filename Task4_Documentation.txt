APEXPLANET WEB DEVELOPMENT INTERNSHIP
 Task 4 Documentation – Securing the Application
 Project Title: MessMate
 Intern Name: Kriti
 Date: October 2025
 1. Objective
 To secure the web application against common web vulnerabilities by implementing
 prepared statements, server-side validation, and role-based access control.
 2. Security Measures Implemented
 Prepared Statements (MySQLi)
 • All SQL queries are converted into MySQLi prepared statements to prevent SQL
 Injection attacks.
 • Example:
 $stmt = $conn->prepare('INSERT INTO users (name, email, password,
 role) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)');
 $stmt->bind_param('ssss', $name, $email, $password, $role);
 $stmt->execute();
 Server-Side Validation
 • Validation is applied for all forms (registration, login).
 • Fields checked for empty values, valid email format, and secure passwords.
 • Prevents invalid or malicious data from entering the database.
 Role-Based Access Control
 • Each user in the system has a role (admin, editor, user).
 • Restricted pages are protected using PHP sessions.
 • Example:
 if ($_SESSION['role'] !== 'admin') { header('Location:
 access_denied.php'); exit(); }
 Password Security
 • Passwords are hashed using the MD5 algorithm before being stored.
 • This prevents exposure of plain-text passwords.
 3. Results
 SQL Injection prevention using prepared statements.
 Server-side validation successfully implemented.
 Role-based access and user management working properly.
 Passwords stored securely with hashing.
 4. Conclusion
 The application is now secure and follows good coding practices. Prepared statements,
 form validation, and user roles ensure data safety and integrity, protecting the system from
 common attacks.
 5. Optional Enhancement
 Client-side validation can be added using JavaScript for better user experience. However,
 server-side validation ensures security even if client-side scripts are disabled
